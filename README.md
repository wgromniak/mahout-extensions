# Attribute selection extensions to Mahout

This is a libarary extending the machine learning library [Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/) with 
[attribute selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection) functionality. It is developed by
an informal research group at the [Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics]
(http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/) at the [University of Warsaw](http://www.uw.edu.pl/). Members of the group are
the following MSc students in matematics: Pawe≈Ç Olszewski, Krzysztof Rutkowski and Wiktor Gromniak. It is
supervised by Proffesor Andrzej Skowron, who is heading the Goup of Logics.

The library currently features two attribute selection frameworks: one based on reducts and the other
based on decision trees.
